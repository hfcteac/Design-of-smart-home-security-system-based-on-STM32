基于stm32的智能家居安防系统设计
本设计为基于单片机智能家居安防系统设计，该系统是基于stm32和各种传感器来完成总体整体设计的，该系统具有火焰检测、煤气检测、室内温湿度检测、室内防盗的功能，同时具备将传感器采集到的数据发送到自己搭建的服务器，并通过网络向用户展示室内情况的功能。
该系统通过火焰传感器检测室内是否有火焰产生来判断是否发送火灾，同时具备发生火灾时的水泵灭火功能。煤气检测是通过气体传感器检测室内气体浓度是否超标，
同时具备排风扇等安全防护功能。室内温湿度检测是通过DHT11传感器检测室内的温湿度，并根据室内的温湿度启动相应的措施来进行调节，保证室内保持一个适宜的环境。而室内防盗是通过红外线传感器来实现的，通过红外线，保证能够准确的判断是否有人入侵，然后在进行报警处理。最后通过ESP8266将主控系统收集到的各个传感器的数据发送到云端，然后再通过云端将信息实时传送给用户。

This design is based on the single-chip microcomputer smart home security system design, the system is based on STM32 and a variety of sensors to complete the overall overall design, the system has flame detection, gas detection, indoor temperature and humidity detection, indoor anti-theft function, at the same time has the sensor to collect the data to send their own server, and through the network to show the user the function of indoor situation.
The system uses a flame sensor to detect whether a flame is generated in the room to determine whether a fire is sent, and it also has a water pump fire extinguishing function in the event of a fire. Gas detection is to detect whether the indoor gas concentration exceeds the standard through the gas sensor.
At the same time, it has safety protection functions such as exhaust fans. Indoor temperature and humidity detection is to detect the indoor temperature and humidity through the DHT11 sensor, and start corresponding measures according to the indoor temperature and humidity to adjust, to ensure that the indoor environment is maintained a suitable environment. The indoor anti-theft is achieved through infrared sensors, through infrared, to ensure that it can accurately judge whether someone has invaded, and then alarm processing. Finally, the data collected by each sensor collected by the main control system is sent to the cloud through the ESP8266, and then the information is transmitted to the user in real time through the cloud.
